                    <h2>Body Mass Index(BMI)</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:20px">What Is Bmi? :</p>
<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation that uses your weight and height to estimate your body fat content. It's a widely used tool for screening weight categories that may lead to health problems.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:20px">How to Calculate BMI :</p>
<p>There are online calculators and charts available, but the formula is:</p>
<p>BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m²).</p>
                     <p style="font-size:20px">Benefits of BMI :</p>
<p>1.Health Monitoring : Knowing your BMI can help you track your health and identify potential weight-related risks.</p>
<p>2.Setting Goals : It can be a starting point for setting weight management or fitness goals.</p></p>
                     <p style="font-size:20px">Limitations of BMI :</p>
<p>1.Not a Direct Measure of Body Fat : BMI doesn't consider muscle mass, bone density, or body composition.</p>
<p>2.Accuracy for Certain Groups : It may not be entirely accurate for children, pregnant women, older adults, or very muscular individuals.</p>
                     <p style="font-size:20px">Remember :</p>
<p>1.BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnosis.</p>
<p>2.If concerned about your weight or health, consult our healthcare professional.</p>

                    <h2>Single Kidney or Kidney Stones</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:20px">General Tips :</p>
<p>Hydration is Key : Aim for 2-3 liters (8-12 cups) of fluids daily. This dilutes your urine and helps prevent stones from forming. Water is best, but unsweetened teas and citrus juices can be included.</p>
<p>Moderate Protein : Limit animal protein like red meat and organ meats, as they can increase uric acid and strain your remaining kidney. Consider plant-based protein sources like beans, lentils, and tofu.</p>
<p>Balance Calcium and Oxalate : Don't restrict calcium altogether, as it can worsen stone formation. However, pair calcium-rich foods (milk, yogurt) with moderate portions of oxalate-rich foods (spinach, nuts, beets) during a meal. This allows them to bind in the gut, reducing the risk of forming stones in your kidney.</p>
<p>Limit Sodium : High sodium intake can raise blood pressure and potentially increase kidney workload. Focus on fresh foods and limit processed or pre-packaged options.</p>
<p>Watch Vitamin C : High doses of vitamin C supplements can increase oxalate levels in some individuals. Consult your doctor about the appropriate amount for you.</p>

                    <div class="category">
                    <h2>Thyroid Patients</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:20px">Food To Emphasize :</p>
<p>Iodine-Rich Foods : Your thyroid needs iodine to produce hormones. Include iodized salt, seafood (tuna, salmon), seaweed, dairy products, and eggs.</p>
<p>Selenium-Rich Foods : Selenium plays a role in thyroid function. Choose Brazil nuts, tuna, shrimp, lean meats, and whole grains.</p>
<p>Fiber-Rich Foods : Fiber can help with digestion and potentially improve medication absorption. Include fruits (berries, apples), vegetables (broccoli, spinach), and whole grains (brown rice, quinoa).</p>
<p>Healthy Fats : Include moderate amounts of healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts), and olive oil. These support overall health and nutrient absorption.</p>  
                   <P style="font-size:20px">Food To Limit Of :</P>
<P>Goitrogenic Foods : These can interfere with thyroid function in high amounts. Consume cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli) in moderation and cook them thoroughly.</P>
<P>Highly Processed Foods : Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive saturated fat. These offer minimal nutritional value and can contribute to weight gain, impacting thyroid function.</P>
